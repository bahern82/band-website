            </header>
            <p>The Monkees were an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for 
            the American television series The Monkees which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and British actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music 
            was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>Micky Dolenz – vocals, drums, percussion, guitar, synthesizers</p><p>He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually was taught how to play properly. By the
                time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself.[3] He learned to play right-handed and left-footed because of a leg disease called Perthes making his right leg weak.</p>

                </li>
                <li><p>Peter Tork – bass guitar, vocals, guitar, keyboards, banjo</p><p>Tork was a proficient musician, and though the group was not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he was an exception,
                playing what he described as "third chair guitar" on Mike Nesmith's song, "Papa Gene's Blues," from their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their
                recordings. He also co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake"</p><img src="/assets/images/pt.jpg" alt=" Peter Tork"></img></li>
                <li><p>Davy Jones – vocals, percussion, drums, guitar, piano, bass guitar</p><p>Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer"
                In 1967, Jones opened his first store, called Zilch, at 217 Thompson Street in the Greenwich Village section of New York City. The store sold "hip" clothing and accessories and also allowed customers to design their own clothes.[citation needed]
                After the Monkees officially disbanded in 1971, Jones kept himself busy by establishing a New York City-style street market in Los Angeles, called "The Street".</p> <img src="/assets/images/dj.jpg" alt=" Davy jones"></img>
                </li>
                <li><p>Michael Nesmith – guitar, vocals, keyboards, harmonica</p><p>After the break-up of the Monkees, Nesmith continued his successful songwriting and performing career, first with the seminal country rock group the First
                National Band, with whom he had a top-40 hit "Joanne", and then as a solo artist. He was a noted player of the twelve-string guitar, performing on custom-built twelve-string electric guitars with the Monkees (built by Gretsch) and various twelve-string acoustic models he played during his post-Monkees career.
                He is also an executive producer of the cult film Repo Man (1984). In 1981, Nesmith won the first Grammy Award given for Video of the Year for his hour-long television show, Elephant Parts</p>
